# Python Programs: Factorial and Math Module Calculations

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs demonstrating fundamental programming concepts:

1. Calculating the factorial of a number using a function and user input.
2. Performing math calculations (square root, natural logarithm, sine) on user input using Python's built-in `math` module.

---

## Program 1: Factorial Calculation

Calculates the factorial of an entered number using a loop.


## Program 2: Math Module Calculations

Uses the Python `math` module to calculate the square root, natural logarithm, and sine (in radians) of a user-entered number.
